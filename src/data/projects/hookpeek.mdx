# HookPeek

HookPeek is a **webhook inspection and debugging tool** built to help developers understand what third party services actually send to their backend.

It focuses on **observation, not processing** capturing raw webhook requests exactly as they arrive.

---

## Why HookPeek Exists

Webhook debugging is painful:

- Payments succeed but backend state doesn’t update
- Providers retry webhooks without clear visibility
- Logs miss headers, retries, or malformed payloads

HookPeek exists to remove guesswork and show **raw truth**.

---

## Core Features

### Webhook Endpoint Generation

- Generate a temporary webhook URL instantly
- Plug it into Stripe or any webhook provider
- No authentication required to start

Simple and fast.

---

### Request Inspection

- Capture **any HTTP method**
- Store raw request bodies (JSON or plain text)
- Inspect headers and query parameters
- View retries and delivery attempts

Nothing is parsed or altered.

---

### Request History & Pagination

- Timestamped request logs
- Paginated views for high-volume traffic
- Click-to-inspect detailed request payloads

Built for real-world debugging.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

- Incoming webhook requests captured via API routes
- Raw payloads stored safely without assumptions
- PostgreSQL used for persistence
- Cleanup jobs remove stale data automatically

Designed to survive malformed input and retries.

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend**

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Drizzle ORM

---

## Challenges Faced

- Handling invalid or non-JSON payloads safely
- Supporting all HTTP methods in Next.js routes
- Preventing race conditions during request counting
- Designing secure cron jobs for data cleanup

---

## Key Learnings

- Webhook systems must never assume payload shape
- Safe parsing is critical for production stability
- Databases should handle concurrency, not application logic
- Cleanup and retention are essential for long-running systems

---

## Status

HookPeek is **actively developed** and verified using real Stripe webhooks.

---

HookPeek is built with a single goal:  
**Stop guessing. See your webhooks.**

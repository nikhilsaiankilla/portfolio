# Dumcel Cloud

Dumcel Cloud is a **React-focused cloud deployment platform** designed to make deploying frontend applications straightforward and observable.  
Connect a GitHub repository, trigger a deployment manually, and Dumcel handles builds, containers, logs, and deployment history.

---

## Why Dumcel Exists

Frontend developers need:
- Predictable deployments
- Clear visibility into builds
- Control over when code goes live
- No deep DevOps knowledge

Dumcel removes infrastructure friction while keeping developers in control.

---

## Core Features

### GitHub Integration

- Secure GitHub OAuth integration
- Repository access for build pipelines
- Webhook support for metadata and commit context

Deployments are **manual by design**, not automatic.

---

### Manual Deployment Pipeline

- Deploy when *you* decide
- Deterministic, containerized builds
- Isolated build environments per deployment

No surprise production changes.

---

### Logs & Deployment History

- Real-time build logs during deployments
- Persistent logs for debugging
- Full deployment history with commit references and status

Observability is a core feature.

---

### Custom Domains & Routing

- Wildcard custom domain support
- Automatic domain mapping per project
- Reverse proxy for routing traffic to active deployments

Production-ready networking without manual setup.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Microservices Architecture

- Independent services for builds, deployments, logging, and orchestration
- Event-driven communication between services
- Fault isolation to prevent cascading failures

Designed for long-term scalability.

---

### Infrastructure

- **Docker** for build isolation
- **AWS ECS** for container orchestration
- **Kafka** for event pipelines
- **Redis** for queues and ephemeral state
- **Node.js** services for orchestration and APIs

---

## Infrastructure & Demo Environment Notes

To keep the platform sustainable for demo and portfolio usage, certain background and orchestration components are currently **scaled down or disabled**.

- The full ECS-based microservices architecture, Kafka event pipeline, and Redis-backed coordination layers have been designed, implemented, and validated.
- Continuous background workers and high-throughput pipelines are paused where not required for interactive demos.
- All services remain containerized with preserved deployment workflows and can be re-enabled or scaled horizontally when needed.

This setup reflects real-world platform engineering tradeoffs: maintaining production-grade architecture while optimizing operational cost during early-stage usage.

## Challenges Faced

- Designing reliable microservice boundaries
- Streaming logs in real time
- Deployment state consistency across services
- Secure domain routing and reverse proxy setup
- Preventing partial failures from impacting the platform

---

## Key Learnings

- Microservices system design
- Platform observability patterns
- Reverse proxy and domain routing
- Event-driven orchestration
- Building developer-focused infrastructure

---

## Status

Dumcel Cloud is **Deployed** you can try it now.  
The focus is on stability, observability, and clean system boundaries before broader adoption.

# Visly Analytics

Visly is a **privacy-first web analytics platform** designed for developers who want meaningful insights without complex setup, invasive tracking, or bloated dashboards.  
The goal is simple: **drop in minimal config, and Visly handles the rest**.

Page views, clicks, visitors, sessions — tracked automatically.

---

## Why Visly Exists

Most analytics tools fail in one of two ways:

- Too complex to set up correctly
- Too invasive to user privacy

Visly is built for modern developers who want:

- Zero or near-zero configuration
- Real-time insights
- Full ownership of their data
- No cookies, no fingerprinting, no dark patterns

---

## Core Features

### Minimal Configuration

- Add a lightweight SDK
- Provide a project key
- Start receiving analytics instantly

No event schemas to define. No dashboards to wire manually.

---

### Automatic Tracking

Visly automatically captures:

- **Page Views** – route changes and navigation
- **Visitors** – anonymous, privacy-safe identification
- **Sessions** – intelligent sessionization
- **Clicks & Interactions** – key UI interactions without manual instrumentation

All without cookies or personal data.

---

### Privacy-First by Design

- No cookies
- No fingerprinting
- No personal identifiers
- GDPR-friendly by default

Analytics should not come at the cost of user trust.

---

### Real-Time Analytics

- Events ingested in real time
- Live dashboards powered by a high-performance data pipeline
- Designed to handle high write throughput with low latency reads

---

## Technical Architecture

### Event Ingestion Pipeline

- Lightweight SDK sends events
- Events flow through **Kafka** for durability and scale
- **Redis** used for fast session lookups and caching
- **ClickHouse** powers analytical queries at scale
- **PostgreSQL** stores metadata and configuration

Built to scale from side projects to high-traffic products.

---

### Session & Visitor Modeling

- Privacy-safe visitor identification
- Intelligent session windows
- Accurate aggregation without invasive tracking

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend & Infrastructure**

- Node.js
- Kafka
- Redis
- ClickHouse
- PostgreSQL

---

## Challenges Faced

- Designing a truly zero-config analytics flow
- Handling high-throughput event ingestion
- Accurate sessionization without cookies
- Query performance at scale
- Keeping the SDK lightweight and fast

---

## Infrastructure & Demo Environment Notes

To keep the demo environment lightweight and cost-efficient, some background processing components are currently **disabled**.

- The full event pipeline (Kafka → Worker → ClickHouse) has been designed, implemented, and validated.
- Continuous background workers are paused in the demo environment since real-time processing is not required for showcasing core functionality.
- All architectural components, deployment configurations, and scaling paths remain intact and can be re-enabled as needed.

This approach allows Visly to demonstrate production-grade system design while avoiding unnecessary infrastructure cost during development and portfolio usage.

---

## Key Learnings

- Analytics system design at scale
- Event-driven architectures
- ClickHouse query optimization
- Designing developer-friendly SDKs
- Privacy-first product thinking

---

## Status

Visly is currently **under active development**.  
The focus is on stability, performance, and an exceptional developer experience before public launch.

---

If analytics should be invisible, fast, and respectful — Visly is built for that.
